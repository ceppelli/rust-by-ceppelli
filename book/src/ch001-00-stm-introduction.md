# State Machine Introduction

The State Behavioral Pattern as documented by the Gang of Four is close to the concept of finite state machine.

This is one of my favorite design pattern I'm using every times I have to model a complex interaction in an user interface.

In this chapter I'm trying to evaluate different STM implementations looking for the right balance between flexibility, correctness and performance.
