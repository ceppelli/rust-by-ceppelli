## Preface

This is a work in progress book, it is now and it will be for the foreseeable future.
It doesn't want to be something extremely refined and precise, but more a collection of thoughts, reasoning and solutions related to the rust language.

## [Chapter 001](./ch001-00-stm-introduction.md)
In this chapter I'm trying to evaluate different STM implementations looking for the right balance between flexibility, correctness and performance.
